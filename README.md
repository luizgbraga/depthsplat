Abstract: *Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.*

## Step-by-step Tutorial

Jonathan Stephens made a fantastic step-by-step tutorial for setting up Gaussian Splatting on your machine, along with instructions for creating usable datasets from videos. If the instructions below are too dry for you, go ahead and check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtuigy_wYc).

## Colab

User [camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru) was kind enough to provide a Colab template that uses this repo's source (status: August 2023!) for quick and easy access to the method. Please check it out [here](https://github.com/camenduru/gaussian-splatting-colab).

## Cloning the Repository

The repository contains submodules, thus please check it out with 
```shell
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting.git --recursive
```
or
```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting --recursive
```

## Overview

The codebase has 4 main components:
- A PyTorch-based optimizer to produce a 3D Gaussian model from SfM inputs
- A network viewer that allows to connect to and visualize the optimization process
- An OpenGL-based real-time viewer to render trained models in real-time.
- A script to help you turn your own images into optimization-ready SfM data sets

The components have different requirements w.r.t. both hardware and software. They have been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04. Instructions for setting up and running each of them are found in the sections below.

## Optimizer

The optimizer uses PyTorch and CUDA extensions in a Python environment to produce trained models. 

### Hardware Requirements

- CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- 24 GB VRAM (to train to paper evaluation quality)
- Please see FAQ for smaller VRAM configurations

### Software Requirements
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- C++ Compiler for PyTorch extensions (we used Visual Studio 2019 for Windows)
- CUDA SDK 11 for PyTorch extensions, install *after* Visual Studio (we used 11.8, **known issues with 11.6**)
- C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK must be compatible

### Setup

#### Local Setup

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```
Please note that this process assumes that you have CUDA SDK **11** installed, not **12**. For modifications, see below.

Tip: Downloading packages and creating a new environment with Conda can require a significant amount of disk space. By default, Conda will use the main system hard drive. You can avoid this by specifying a different package download location and an environment on a different drive:

```shell
conda config --add pkgs_dirs <Drive>/<pkg_path>
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
conda activate <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
```

#### Modifications

If you can afford the disk space, we recommend using our environment files for setting up a training environment identical to ours. If you want to make modifications, please note that major version changes might affect the results of our method. However, our (limited) experiments suggest that the codebase works just fine inside a more up-to-date environment (Python 3.8, PyTorch 2.0.0, CUDA 12). Make sure to create an environment where PyTorch and its CUDA runtime version match and the installed CUDA SDK has no major version difference with PyTorch's CUDA version.

#### Known Issues

Some users experience problems building the submodules on Windows (```cl.exe: File not found``` or similar). Please consider the workaround for this problem from the FAQ.

### Running

To run the optimizer, simply use

```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset>
```

Note that similar to MipNeRF360, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. For convenience, arbitrary-size inputs can be passed and will be automatically resized if their width exceeds 1600 pixels. We recommend to keep this behavior, but you may force training to use your higher-resolution images by setting ```-r 1```.

The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/). You can find our SfM data sets for Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip). If you do not provide an output model directory (```-m```), trained models are written to folders with randomized unique names inside the ```output``` directory. At this point, the trained models may be viewed with the real-time viewer (see further below).

### Evaluation
By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:
```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --eval # Train with train/test split
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

If you want to evaluate our [pre-trained models](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/pretrained/models.zip), you will have to download the corresponding source data sets and indicate their location to ```render.py``` with an additional ```--source_path/-s``` flag. Note: The pre-trained models were created with the release codebase. This code base has been cleaned up and includes bugfixes, hence the metrics you get from evaluating them will differ from those in the paper.
```shell
python render.py -m <path to pre-trained model> -s <path to COLMAP dataset>
python metrics.py -m <path to pre-trained model>
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for render.py</span></summary>

  Path to the trained model directory you want to create renderings for.
  #### --skip_train
  Flag to skip rendering the training set.
  #### --skip_test
  Flag to skip rendering the test set.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe. 

  **The below parameters will be read automatically from the model path, based on what was used for training. However, you may override them by providing them explicitly on the command line.** 

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval

  #### --resolution / -r
  Changes the resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. ```1``` by default.
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --convert_SHs_python
  Flag to make pipeline render with computed SHs from PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --convert_cov3D_python

We further provide the ```full_eval.py``` script. This script specifies the routine used in our evaluation and demonstrates the use of some additional parameters, e.g., ```--images (-i)``` to define alternative image directories within COLMAP data sets. If you have downloaded and extracted all the training data, you can run it like this:
```shell
python full_eval.py -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```
In the current version, this process takes about 7h on our reference machine containing an A6000. If you want to do the full evaluation on our pre-trained models, you can specify their download location and skip training. 
```shell
python full_eval.py -o <directory with pretrained models> --skip_training -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```

If you want to compute the metrics on our paper's [evaluation images](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/evaluation/images.zip), you can also skip rendering. In this case it is not necessary to provide the source datasets. You can compute metrics for multiple image sets at a time. 
```shell
python full_eval.py -m <directory with evaluation images>/garden ... --skip_training --skip_rendering
```

<details>

## Processing your own Scenes

Our COLMAP loaders expect the following dataset structure in the source path location:

```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```

For rasterization, the camera models must be either a SIMPLE_PINHOLE or PINHOLE camera. We provide a converter script ```convert.py```, to extract undistorted images and SfM information from input images. Optionally, you can use ImageMagick to resize the undistorted images. This rescaling is similar to MipNeRF360, i.e., it creates images with 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 the original resolution in corresponding folders. To use them, please first install a recent version of COLMAP (ideally CUDA-powered) and ImageMagick. Put the images you want to use in a directory ```<location>/input```.
```
<location>
|---input
    |---<image 0>
    |---<image 1>
    |---...
```
 If you have COLMAP and ImageMagick on your system path, you can simply run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```
Alternatively, you can use the optional parameters ```--colmap_executable``` and ```--magick_executable``` to point to the respective paths. Please note that on Windows, the executable should point to the COLMAP ```.bat``` file that takes care of setting the execution environment. Once done, ```<location>``` will contain the expected COLMAP data set structure with undistorted, resized input images, in addition to your original images and some temporary (distorted) data in the directory ```distorted```.

If you have your own COLMAP dataset without undistortion (e.g., using ```OPENCV``` camera), you can try to just run the last part of the script: Put the images in ```input``` and the COLMAP info in a subdirectory ```distorted```:
```
<location>
|---input
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---distorted
    |---database.db
    |---sparse
        |---0
            |---...
```
Then run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> --skip_matching [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```

<details>

  #### --no_gpu
  Flag to avoid using GPU in COLMAP.
  #### --skip_matching
  Flag to indicate that COLMAP info is available for images.
  #### --source_path / -s
  Location of the inputs.
  #### --camera
